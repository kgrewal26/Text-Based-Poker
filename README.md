# Text-Based-Poker


This is a text-based poker game made using Python. The user plays against a computer and can keep playing until they choose to stop, or one of them goes bankrupt. This is a 3-Card Poker game and the types of potential hands were inspired by actual poker, but are not the same.

The Types of hands from best to worst are:
1. A Straight with the Same Suit (e.g 6, 7, 8 of Hearts)
2. A triple match (e.g 7 of Hearts, 7 of Spades, 7 of Clubs)
3. A Straight (e.g 4, 5, 6)
4. A double match (e.g 4 of Hearts, 4 of Clubs, any card that isnt a 4)
5. A Same Suit (e.g 4, 8, 9 of Clubs).
6. Nothing (None of the Above).

The player with the best hand wins the round and gets the bet money. If there is a tie, nothing changes.

When the games ends, the player with the most money wins.

As a final note, the game uses number only to identify cards. This means that instead of there being Aces, Jacks, Queens or Kings, the numbers 1, 11, 12, 13 are used respectively.
